Lansdale wrote the screenplay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent d&rsquo;Onofrio directed and starred, with a terrific cast of supporting players.&nbsp;&nbsp; We shot it in Santa Fe, entirely on greenscreen.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wizards at Trioscope did the rest, providing the sets, the aliens, the special effects, pretty much everything except the actors and the horses.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be rolling it out at a series of film festivals through the rest of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp; My staff is working out that schedule now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we have some confirmed dates and places, we will share the details here.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, we hope to start shooting a&nbsp;<em>second&nbsp;</em>Howard Waldrop film in about two weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Completely unrelated.&nbsp;&nbsp; H&rsquo;ard (as Gargy used to call him) never wrote the same story twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may be the Year of Waldrop.</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s always more.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that will need to do for now.</p>', '2022-05-04 12:23:06', 'NeverGonnaFinish', '0'),
